Hello! I'm Troy Ciesco. I'm a full-stack software engineer from Connecticut, now in Boston.

The TL;DR is I started coding seriously in 2014 and I've been lucky enough to work in a lot of different environments - startups, local businesses, contracting, big companies you've heard of (Disney/Hulu), and crypto.
