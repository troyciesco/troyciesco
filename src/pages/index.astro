				<p>
					I'm a software engineer in Boston. I mostly use JavaScript/TypeScript
					with React, Vue or Svelte. I've also worked with Python and GraphQL.
				</p>
				<p>
					I currently work as a freelancer, and I specialize in jumping into
					projects with tight deadlines that need a spark. If you or your team
					need something built fast and well, <a

						class="font-bold underline text-link">get in touch on LinkedIn</a
					>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Previously I've worked at places like Hulu and Gemini, as well as
					startups at various stages of growth. I also spent six years in the US
					Army Reserve.
				</p>

				<p>
					My hobbies include baseball, video games, and studying history. I've
					also recently picked up wildlife photography, and it's been fun to dig
					into both the technical and artistic aspects of that.
