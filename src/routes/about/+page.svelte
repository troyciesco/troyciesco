  <p class="prose mb-4">
    I'm a full-stack engineer, but I tend to work on the frontend more than the backend. I've done a lot with React and
    TypeScript on the frontend, and I work with Node.js or Python on the backend. I find trying new technologies
    regularly - like GraphQL or the aforementioned Svelte - keeps things interesting.

  <p class="prose mb-4">
    My hobbies include baseball, video games, and studying history. I've also recently picked up wildlife photography,
    and it's been fun to dig into both the technical and artistic aspects of that. I live in Mansfield, CT.
