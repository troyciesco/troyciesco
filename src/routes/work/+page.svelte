      I have experience working with enterprise companies, small businesses, blockchain startups, and everything in
      between. I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript development, particularly with React, and I have professional
      experience with other technologies like Python and GraphQL. I also spent six years in the US Army Reserve.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Job History</h2>
    <p class="prose mb-4">
      I actually started my career working for a municipal planning department! The town launched a new website while I
      was there and my curiosity got the best of me - I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and helped a handful
      of departments set up their part of the website.
    </p>
    <p class="prose mb-4">
      After a few years of learning, picking up extra projects related to coding and design, and helping with a move to
      an online permitting system, I decided to leave in 2016 to pursue a career in software development. I built a few
      client sites, but spent most of these years working for smaller, local New England companies.
    </p>
    <p class="prose mb-4">
      I spent the pandemic years doing some contracting and working for a few larger, well-known companies. I worked on
      the Ad Experience team at Hulu and learned a ton about good software development practices and working with a
      strong, senior-level team. Then I spent some time contributing to the NFT craze with Nifty Gateway (part of
      Gemini).
    </p>
    <p class="prose mb-4">
      Since August 2022, I've been doing contract work for clients in between working on some of my own projects and
      finally wrapping up my bachelors degree.

        wild, using SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind, Keystone.js, and GraphQL. Still very much a work in progress - there's
        lorem ipsum text and some designs aren't fully developed yet - but architecting the Svelte backend and GraphQL backend
        was really interesting!
